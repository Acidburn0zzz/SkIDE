Development Repository for Sk-IDE.

# Description
Skript is a Plugin for the Minecraft Multiplayer that allows Server Owners to modify the server with a Skript language in simple english sentences. 

Still Skript has a clear syntax that needs to be followed, Sk-IDE provides you with a more easy way to create Scripts.
Sk-IDE is a fully featured IDE, providing Autocomplete, Syntax Highlighting and a lot more things like Plugin Support.

# Code
Sk-IDE is written completely in Kotlin currently, you still can pull request with Java Code.

For the gui Sk-IDE uses JavaFX, highlighting is provided by RichTextFX.
