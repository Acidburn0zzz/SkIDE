Development Repository for SkIDE.

# Description
Skript is a Plugin for the Minecraft Multiplayer that allows Server Owners to modify the server with a Skript language in simple english sentences. 

Still Skript has a clear syntax that needs to be followed, SkIDE provides you with a more easy way to create Skripts.
SkIDE is a fully featured IDE, providing Autocomplete, Syntax Highlighting and a lot more things like Plugin Support.

# Code
SkIDE is written completely in Kotlin currently, you still can pull request with Java Code.

For the gui SkIDE uses JavaFX, highlighting is provided by RichTextFX.
